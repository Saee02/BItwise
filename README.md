# Bitwise

Bitwise operators (work at bit-level)


The & (bitwise AND) : Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.


The | (bitwise OR): Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.


The ^ (bitwise XOR): Takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.


The << (left shift) : Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

The >> (right shift) :Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.


The ~ (bitwise NOT): Takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
