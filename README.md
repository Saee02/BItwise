# Bitwise
bitwise operators (work at bit-level)
The & (bitwise AND) : takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.
The | (bitwise OR): takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.
The ^ (bitwise XOR): takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.
The << (left shift) :takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
The >> (right shift) :takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
The ~ (bitwise NOT): takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
